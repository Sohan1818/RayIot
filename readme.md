# Real-time Data Visualization

This project is a simple web application for visualizing real-time data on a graph. It generates sample data for temperature, humidity, and pressure, and displays it on a graph using HTML canvas and JavaScript.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of temperature, humidity, and pressure data on a graph.
- Minimalistic design without using external libraries.
- Automatic data generation and updating every 10 seconds.
